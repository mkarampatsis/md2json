# Exercise 39: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List remove() Method


## Subchapter Introduction
The remove() Method is used to delete the item `value` from the list `listname`.

```python
listname.remove(value)
```
If the `value` appears more than once in the `listname`, only the first matching item is deleted.

If the `value` does not exist in the `listname`, then the command returns an error message.

## Exercise Description
Create a list `nums` with the values `[0,3,6,3,2,1,4]` and delete the integer `3`. This number exists twice in the list. Print the updated list.

## Code
```python
nums = [0,3,6,3,2,1,4]

nums.remove(3)
nums.remove(3)

print(nums)
```

## Output Data
[0, 6, 2, 1, 4]

## Hints

### Hint 1

```python
listname.remove(value)
```

### Hint 2
To remove a `value` more than once from a list `listname` write the command more times.
