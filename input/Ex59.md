# Exercise 59: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List pop() Method, Python Functions, Python While Loops: What is While Loop


## Exercise Description
Create the list `xy` with the values `[2,3,'x',4,'y',5]`. Delete the first item of the list until the list contains only three items. Use the length function and While Loop. Print the final list `xy`.

## Code
```python
xy = [2,3,'x',4,'y',5]

while len(xy)>3 :
    xy.pop(0)

print(xy)
```

## Output Data
[4, 'y', 5]
