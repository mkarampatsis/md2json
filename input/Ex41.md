# Exercise 41: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List remove() Method: List Method Count, Python While Loops: For Loop


## Exercise Description
Create the list `n` with the values `[0,3,5,1,2,1,4,6,8,1,9,7]`. Count how many times the integer `1` appears in the list, save that number as a new variable `m` and print the `m`. Then, delete all the `1`s from the list by using for loop and print the updated list `n`.

## Code
```python
n = [0,3,5,1,2,1,4,6,8,1,9,7]

m = n.count(1)
print(m)

for i in range(1,m+1) :
    n.remove(1)

print(n)
```

## Output Data
3^[0, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7]

## Hints

### Hint 1
To remove a `value` from a list `listname` write:

```python
listname.remove(value)
```

### Hint 2
To count how many times a `value` exists in a list write:

```python
listname.count(value)
```

#### Penalty
20 Points


### Hint 3
To create the for loop use this form of code:

```python
for counter in sequence :
	expressions
```

#### Penalty
20 Points


### Hint 4
Use `range(1,m+1)` as the sequence for the for loop.
