## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: Difference between del, remove and pop functions


## Subchapter Introduction
The del function is used to remove one or more items from a list `listname` by defining the `index or indices` of the item(s).

```python
del listname[index or indices]
```

The remove function is used to delete the item `value` from the list `listname`. If the `value` appears more than once in the `listname`, only the first matching item is deleted.

```python
listname.remove(value)
```

The pop function is used to delete the item of a specific `index` from the list `listname` and return the deleted item. If the `index` is not defined, it is considered to be `-1` (i.e. the last item) by default.The removed item may be displayed on the screen (first command line) or be saved as a new variable (second command line).

```python
listname.pop(index)

removedvalue = listname.pop(index)
```

If the `value` or the `index` do not correspond to any item of the list `listname`, then the commands return an error message. 


## Exercise Description
The del, remove and pop functions can be used to delete one or more items from a list, even another list if this is an item of the big list.

Create a list `x` with the values `[1,2,[3,4]]` and delete the list `[3,4]` which is the third item of the list `x`. Print the updated list.

## Code
```python
x = [1,2,[3,4]]

del x[2]

print(x)
```

## Output Data
[1, 2]

## Hints

### Hint 1
To delete one or more items of specific `index or indices` from a list `listname` write:

```python
del listname[index or indices]
```
