# Exercise 44: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Exercise Description
Create the list `nums` with the values `[[1,3,5,7,9],[0,2,4,6,7,8]]`. Delete the fifth item of the second item of the list `nums` without saving it as a new variable. Print the updated list.

## Code
```python
nums = [[1,3,5,7,9],[0,2,4,6,7,8]]

nums[1].pop(4)

print(nums)
```

## Output Data
[[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
