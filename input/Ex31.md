# Exercise 31: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List clear() Method


## Subchapter Introduction

## Code
```python
seasons = ['winter','spring','summer','autumn']
print(seasons)

seasons.clear()
print(seasons)
```

## Output Data
['winter', 'spring', 'summer', 'autumn']^[]
