# Exercise 56: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List append() Method, Python Functions, Python While Loops: What is While Loop


## Exercise Description
Create an empty list `one` and fill it with `1`s until the length of the list is `5`, by using While Loop and the length function. Print the list.

## Code
```python
one = []

while len(one)<5 :
    one.append(1)

print(one)
```

## Output Data
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
