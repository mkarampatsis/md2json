## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```
