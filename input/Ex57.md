# Exercise 57: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List append() Method, Python Functions, Python If...Else: Working with IF & IF-ELSE Statement


## Exercise Description
Create the list `nums` with the values `[20,30,15,10]`. Calculate the sum of the items of the list and save it as a new variable `s`. If `s` is smaller than `100`, then add the appropriate integer at the end of the list, so that the new sum of the items of the list is equal to 100. Print the list.

## Code
```python
nums = [20,30,15,10]

s = sum(nums)

if s<100 :
    nums.append(100-s)

print(nums)
```

## Output Data
[20, 30, 15, 10, 25]

## Hints

### Hint 1
To add an item (`value`) at the end of a list write:

```python
listname.append(value)
```

#### Penalty
20 Points


### Hint 2
To calculate the sum of the items of a list use the sum() function:

```python
sum(listname)
```

#### Penalty
20 Points


### Hint 3

To create the if-elif statement use this form of code:

```python
if condition :
	expressions
else :
	expressions
```

#### Penalty
20 Points

### Hint 4

The integer which will be added at the end of the list is `100-sum(nums)`.
