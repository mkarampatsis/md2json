# Exercise 34: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: List index() Method


## Subchapter Introduction
The index() Method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the `value` in the `listname`.

```python
listname.index(value,start,end)
```

The values `start` and `end` are optional and specify where to search for the `value` in the `listname`.

If the `value` does not exist in the `listname`, then the command returns an error message.


## Exercise Description
Create a list `n` with the values `[0,2,3,1,6,8,1,9]`. The integer `1` appears twice in this list. Print the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in `n` by using the index() Method. Then change the area of searching by setting the `start` value as the index from before plus 1, and print the index of the second occurrence of the integer `1`.

## Code
```python
n = [0,2,3,1,6,8,1,9]

print(n.index(1))
print(n.index(1,4))
```

## Output Data
3^6

## Hints

### Hint 1
To return the index of the first occurrence of `value` in the `listname`, between `start` and `end` indeces, write:

```python
listname.index(value,start,end)
```
