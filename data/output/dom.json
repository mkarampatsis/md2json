{"introduction":["<p>python string formatting is a powerful feature that allows you to create dynamic and formatted strings. it provides different techniques to insert values or variables into a string and control their representation.</p>"],"subintroduction":["<p>some key concepts and techniques you should learn about python string formatting:</p>","<ol>\n<li>string interpolation with f-strings: introduced in python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals. you can directly include variables or expressions within curly braces {} in the string, and they will be evaluated and replaced with their values. for example:</li>\n</ol>","<pre><code class=\"py3 language-py3\">name = \"alice\"\nage = 25\nprint(f\"my name is {name} and i am {age} years old.\")\n</code></pre>","<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>format method: the format() method is a versatile way to format strings in python. it allows you to insert values into specific locations in a string using placeholders defined by curly braces {}. you can provide values directly or refer to them by their positions or names. examples:</li>\n</ol>","<pre><code class=\"py3 language-py3\">name = \"bob\"\nage = 30\nprint(\"my name is {} and i am {} years old.\".format(name, age))\nprint(\"my name is {0} and i am {1} years old.\".format(name, age))\nprint(\"my name is {name} and i am {age} years old.\".format(name=name, age=age))\n</code></pre>","<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>f-strings vs. format(): both f-strings and the format() method are widely used for string formatting. while f-strings offer a more concise and readable syntax, the format() method provides greater flexibility, such as specifying formatting options for numbers, dates, alignment, and more.</p></li>\n<li><p>formatting options: python string formatting offers various formatting options to control the appearance of the inserted values. some common options include:</p></li>\n</ol>","<ul>\n<li>specifying the width and alignment of the field</li>\n<li>controlling the number of decimal places for floating-point numbers</li>\n<li>formatting numbers as currency or percentages</li>\n<li>adding leading zeros or custom fill characters</li>\n<li>formatting dates and times</li>\n</ul>","<p>these options can be applied using format specifiers within the curly braces {}. example:</p>","<pre><code class=\"py3 language-py3\">price = 19.99\nprint(\"the price is: ${:.2f}\".format(price))\n</code></pre>","<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>escape characters: if you need to include curly braces or literal characters within a formatted string, you can use double curly braces {{}} to escape them. for example:</li>\n</ol>","<pre><code class=\"py3 language-py3\">name = \"john\"\nprint(f\"{{name}} is a variable.\")\n</code></pre>"],"exercise_description":["<p>format a string with exponential notation using format method.
