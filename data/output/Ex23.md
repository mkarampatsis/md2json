## Chapter
Functions

## Chapter Introduction
In JavaScript, a function is a block of code that can be reused multiple times. Functions are used to perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times without repeating the code. Functions are declared using the keyword "function" followed by the function name, a set of parentheses ( ) which may include parameters, and a pair of curly braces { } that encloses the function body.

Function Declaration:
A function declaration is the most common way to define a function. It consists of the keyword function, followed by the function name, a list of parameters (enclosed in parentheses) and a function body.

Example:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Function Expression:
A function expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. It assigns a function to a variable.

Example:

```js
let sayHello = function(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Arrow functions (also known as "fat arrow" functions) introduced in ECMAScript 6, is a shorthand for function expressions.

Example:

```js
let sayHello = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Function Parameters and Arguments:
When a function is called, the values passed to the function are known as arguments. These values are passed to the function's parameters.

Example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(3, 4)); // Output: 7
```

In this example, 3 and 4 are the arguments passed to the function, and a and b are the parameters of the function.

Function Return:
A function can return a value by using the return statement. The return statement stops the execution of the function and returns the specified value.

Example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(3, 4)); // Output: 7
```

In this example, the add function takes in two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum.

Function Scope:
In JavaScript, variables declared within a function have function scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function where they are declared. Variables declared outside of a function have global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire program.

Example:

```js
let globalVar = "I am a global variable";

function myFunction() {
  let localVar = "I am a local variable";
  console.log(globalVar);
  console.log(localVar);
}

console.log(globalVar); // Output: "I am a global variable"
console.log(localVar); // Output: ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
```

In this example, globalVar is accessible both inside and outside of the myFunction function, while localVar is only accessible within the function.

These are the basic concepts of functions in JavaScript. Additionally, there are other advanced concepts such as closure, recursion, and hoisting.

## Subchapter
Functions:Currying

## Subchapter Introduction
Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions with a single argument. This allows us to create specialized functions that can be reused with different arguments.

In JavaScript, we can implement currying using closures. We create a function that takes the first argument and returns a new function that takes the second argument, and so on until all arguments are taken. The final function returns the result of applying the original function to all the arguments.

Here is an example of a curried function in JavaScript:

```js
function add(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

// Usage
const add2 = add(2);
console.log(add2(3)); // 5
```

In this example, we have created a add function that takes one argument x and returns a new function that takes a second argument y. The final function returns the sum of x and y. We can create a specialized version of this function using the first argument, and reuse it with different second arguments.

Currying and closure are two different concepts in JavaScript, although they are often used together.

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes one argument at a time. In other words, currying allows you to create a new function that is a specialization of an existing function. This can be useful in situations where you need to reuse a function with different arguments.

Closure, on the other hand, is a feature of JavaScript that allows a function to access variables outside of its own scope. This means that a function can access and manipulate variables that were defined in an outer scope, even after the outer function has returned.

While currying is a technique for transforming functions, closure is a language feature that allows functions to access variables outside of their own scope. Currying can be used with or without closure, and closure can be used without currying.

## Exercise Description
Write a curried function called endWith that takes an array of strings and a letter, and returns a new array of strings that end with that letter. (Input: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'], 'e')

## Code
```js
const endWith = arr => letter => arr.filter(str => str.endsWith(letter));

console.log(endWith(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'])('e'));
```

## Output Data
type=oneline
['apple', 'date']

## Hints

### Hint 1
* The endWith function is a curried function that returns another function as the output.
* The first function takes an array as its input and returns another function.
* The second function takes a letter as its input and returns a filtered array containing only the strings from the original array that end with the input letter.

#### Penalty
20 Points

### Hint 2
* When writing a curried function, it's important to think about how the input data will be passed from one function to the next.
* In this case, we want to pass the array to the first function, and then pass the letter to the second function.
* We can use arrow function notation to create a nested set of functions that will accept these inputs and return the desired output.
