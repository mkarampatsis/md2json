Python Operators

## Chapter Introduction
Python has several types of operators that allow us to manipulate data in various ways. The main types of operators in Python are:

1. Arithmetic Operators: These are the operators that perform mathematical calculations on numerical values. The arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), floor division (//), and exponentiation (**).
2. Relational Operators: These are the operators that compare two values and return a boolean value of True or False based on the relationship between the two values. The relational operators include less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), equality (==), and inequality (!=).
3. Assignment Operators: These are the operators used to assign values to variables. The assignment operators include the equals sign (=), as well as augmented assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, and **=.
4. Increment and Decrement Operators: These are the operators that allow us to increment or decrement a variable's value by 1. The increment operator is represented by "++" and the decrement operator is represented by "--". However, these operators are not directly supported in Python.
5. Logical Operators: These are the operators used to combine or invert boolean values. The logical operators include and, or, and not.
6. Membership Operators: These are the operators that test whether a value is a member of a sequence. The membership operators include in and not in.
7. Identity Operators: These are the operators that test if two variables refer to the same object. The identity operators include is and is not.

Understanding the different types of operators and how they work is essential in Python programming. By using operators, we can manipulate data in many different ways and perform complex operations with ease.

## Subchapter
Python Operators:Working with Arithmetic Operators

## Subchapter Introduction
Arithmetic operators are used in Python to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. These operators work with numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

1. The addition operator (+) is used to add two or more numbers together. For example, 2 + 3 = 5.
2. The subtraction operator (-) is used to subtract one number from another. For example, 5 - 3 = 2.
3. The multiplication operator (*) is used to multiply two or more numbers together. For example, 2 * 3 = 6.
4. The division operator (/) is used to divide one number by another. If both operands are integers, the result will be a floating-point number. If one operand is a floating-point number, the result will also be a floating-point number. For example, 6 / 3 = 2.0.
5. The floor division operator (//) is used to perform integer division, which returns the quotient without the remainder. For example, 7 // 3 = 2.
6. The modulus operator (%) is used to get the remainder of a division operation. For example, 7 % 3 = 1.
7. The exponentiation operator (**) is used to raise one number to the power of another. For example, 2 ** 3 = 8.

In addition to these basic arithmetic operators, Python also supports the use of parentheses to group operations and enforce order of operations. For example, (2 + 3) * 4 = 20.

It is important to note that arithmetic operations in Python follow the standard order of operations (PEMDAS), which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Understanding arithmetic operators is fundamental to working with numerical data in Python. By mastering these operators, students can manipulate and compute numerical data with ease.

## Exercise Description
Calculate the result of the expression 3 * 2 + 4 // 2 - 5 ** 2 and print it to the console using the print method. 

## Code
```py3
print(3 * 2 + 4 // 2 - 5 ** 2)
```

## Output Data
type=oneline
-17
