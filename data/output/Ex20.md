# Exercise 20:JavaScript

## Chapter
Functions

## Chapter Introduction
In JavaScript, a function is a block of code that can be reused multiple times. Functions are used to perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times without repeating the code. Functions are declared using the keyword "function" followed by the function name, a set of parentheses ( ) which may include parameters, and a pair of curly braces { } that encloses the function body.

Function Declaration:
A function declaration is the most common way to define a function. It consists of the keyword function, followed by the function name, a list of parameters (enclosed in parentheses) and a function body.

Example:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Function Expression:
A function expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. It assigns a function to a variable.

Example:

```js
let sayHello = function(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Arrow functions (also known as "fat arrow" functions) introduced in ECMAScript 6, is a shorthand for function expressions.

Example:

```js
let sayHello = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Function Parameters and Arguments:
When a function is called, the values passed to the function are known as arguments. These values are passed to the function's parameters.

Example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(3, 4)); // Output: 7
```

In this example, 3 and 4 are the arguments passed to the function, and a and b are the parameters of the function.

Function Return:
A function can return a value by using the return statement. The return statement stops the execution of the function and returns the specified value.

Example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(3, 4)); // Output: 7
```

In this example, the add function takes in two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum.

Function Scope:
In JavaScript, variables declared within a function have function scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function where they are declared. Variables declared outside of a function have global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire program.

Example:

```js
let globalVar = "I am a global variable";

function myFunction() {
  let localVar = "I am a local variable";
  console.log(globalVar);
  console.log(localVar);
}

console.log(globalVar); // Output: "I am a global variable"
console.log(localVar); // Output: ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
```

In this example, globalVar is accessible both inside and outside of the myFunction function, while localVar is only accessible within the function.

These are the basic concepts of functions in JavaScript. Additionally, there are other advanced concepts such as closure, recursion, and hoisting.

## Subchapter
Functions:Recursion

## Subchapter Introduction
In JavaScript, a recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The process of a function calling itself is called recursion. Recursive functions can be used to solve problems that require repetitive computation or manipulation of nested data structures.

To write a recursive function in JavaScript, you typically start by defining a base case that specifies when the function should stop calling itself. Then you write the function so that it calls itself with a modified set of inputs until the base case is met.

One important concept in recursive functions is the call stack. Each time a function calls itself, a new entry is added to the call stack. When the base case is finally met, the function calls begin to return and the call stack is "unwound", with each function call returning its result to the function that called it.

It's important to be careful when writing recursive functions to avoid infinite loops or stack overflow errors. You should always ensure that there is a base case that will eventually be met, and that the inputs to the function are modified in a way that will eventually reach the base case.

One more important thing to keep in mind is that recursive functions can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too high. Therefore, it's important to properly design and test recursive functions to ensure that they operate efficiently and avoid such errors.

## Exercise Description
Write a recursive function to find a path exists in a directed graph.

Here is the directed graph:

```
A → B → D
↓       ↓
C ----→ E → F
```

You have to think of a proper way to represent this directed graph in your code.

Check if these paths exist:
1. From `A` to `F`
2. From `B` to `C`

In case it exists print true, otherwise false.

## Code
```js
function pathExists(graph, start, end, visited = new Set()) {
  if (!graph.has(start)) {
    return false;
  }
  
  visited.add(start);
  
  if (start === end) {
    return true;
  }
  
  for (let neighbor of graph.get(start)) {
    if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
      if (pathExists(graph, neighbor, end, visited)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return false;
}


const graph = new Map([
  ['A', new Set(['B', 'C'])],
  ['B', new Set(['D'])],
  ['C', new Set(['E'])],
  ['D', new Set(['E'])],
  ['E', new Set(['F'])],
  ['F', new Set()]
]);

console.log(pathExists(graph, 'A', 'F')); // true
console.log(pathExists(graph, 'B', 'C')); // false
```

## Output Data
type=oneline
true^false

## Hints

### Hint 1
One way to represent a directed graph in JavaScript is to use a Map object, where the keys are the nodes and the values are sets of nodes that the key node points to. For example, the graph:

```
A → B → D
↓   ↓
C   E → F
```

```js
const graph = new Map([
  ['A', new Set(['B', 'C'])],
  ['B', new Set(['D'])],
  ['C', new Set()],
  ['D', new Set(['E'])],
  ['E', new Set(['F'])],
  ['F', new Set()]
]);
```

### Hint 2
* The input is a directed graph in the form of an adjacency list and two nodes start and end.
* Create a Set named visited to keep track of the visited nodes.

#### Penalty
20 Points

### Hint 3
* Check if the start node is in the graph.
* Add the start node to the visited set.
* Check if the start node equals the end node. If yes, return true.
* Loop through the neighbors of the start node in the graph. For each neighbor:
  * Check if it's not visited yet. If not, call the pathExists function recursively with the neighbor as the new start node and visited set passed as a parameter.
  * If the pathExists function returns true, it means there is a path from the start node to the end node, so return true.
* If all neighbors have been checked and there is no path found, return false.
