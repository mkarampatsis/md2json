# Exercise 2: Python

## Chapter
Lists

## Chapter Introduction
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data. A list can contain any datatype, even different datatypes.

The items of a list are always in order and it is very easy to add, change or remove elements of a list.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

## Subchapter
Lists: Different Ways to Create List

## Subchapter Introduction
Lists are created using sqaure brackets.

```python
listname = [1,2,3]

print(listname)
```

Another way to create a list is by using the `list() ` method, which takes only one input.

```python
listname = list((1,2,3))

print(listname)
```

## Exercise Description
A list can contain items with different datatypes. Create a list which contains the integer `1`, the string `'one'` and the boolean `True`, in this order, using sqaure brackets. Name it `one` and print it.

## Code
```python
one = [1,'one',True]

print(one)
```
## Output Data
[1, 'one', True]
